Objectives:

- [] Screen capture of successful ‘ h1 ping h2 ’ and ‘ h2 ping h1 ’ commands at
the minnet> prompt.
- [] Your modified legacy_router.py program as a separate test file.
- [] Output of ‘ git log ’ command, showing changes you made to the program
above.
- [] Answers to these questions:
a. Why didn’t the original program forward packets between the hosts?
b. Is the line ‘ r1.cmd('sysctl -w net.ipv4.ip_forward=1') ’ required?
c. Intentionally break your working program, e.g.: change a subnet length, IP
address, or default route for a host. Explain why your change caused the
network to break.
